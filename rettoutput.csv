"Rett syndrome (RTT; OMIM identifier #312750), first 
reported by the Austrian physician Andreas Rett, is a 
devastating neurological disorder that affects brain 
development and function in females in approximately 1 in 10,000 live births
1,2. In 90–95% of patients diagnosed 
with classic RTT , the disease is caused by loss- of-function 
mutations in the X- linked MECP2 gene, which encodes 
methyl- CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2).
MECP2 gene mutations predominantly arise in 
germ cells from the paternal side3. Despite the hun-
dreds of RTT-  causing MECP2 mutations that have 
been identified, eight ‘hotspot’ mutations (encoding the amino acid substitutions R106W , R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X and R306C) con -
stitute more than 60% of documented cases

MeCP2 was initially identified as a nuclear protein 
that binds methylated DNA7 and was therefore described 
as a transcriptional repressor. Later, it was described as a  
multifunctional modulator of gene expression and as  
a transcriptional regulator with activating or repressing actions depending on the molecular context

evidence points to a role of MeCP2 as a weak repressor 
but with prominent secondary effects, including post-  
transcriptional regulation of gene expression through 
microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mechanisms9.A large body of research on RTT produced over two 
decades has greatly advanced our understanding of the functions and regulation of MeCP2 as well as the mech-

ticity that underlies RTT. The purposes of this Review are to provide a synthesis of the field, to assess the pri-mary and secondary molecular actions of MeCP2 and to 
discuss how loss of MeCP2 results in changes in circuit 
function that are associated with RTT.
Clinical features of RTT
RTT is characterized by apparently normal early develop-ment with subsequent regression. However, subtly visible

Abstract | Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene 
encoding methyl- CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Almost two decades of research into RTT have 
greatly advanced our understanding of the function and regulation of the multifunctional protein 
MeCP2. Here, we review recent advances in understanding how loss of MeCP2 impacts different 
stages of brain development, discuss recent findings demonstrating the molecular role of MeCP2 
as a transcriptional repressor , assess primary and secondary effects of MeCP2 loss and examine 
how loss of MeCP2 can result in an imbalance of neuronal excitation and inhibition at the circuit 
level along with dysregulation of activity- dependent mechanisms. These factors present 
challenges to the search for mechanism- based therapeutics for RTT and suggest specific 
approaches that may be more effective than others.

problems are also common in individuals with RTT10,11. 
Impaired development of visual processing and reduced 
visually evoked cortical responses have been reported in 
some patients12,13.
The disease eventually plateaus and stabilizes10. 
Individuals with RTT live into adulthood and often 
require total care. Individuals with RTT may transiently 
exhibit autistic- like behaviours, such as social withdrawal 
and avoidance of eye gaze, during the regression phase, but they often become more interactive and social with 
age
14. Notably, RTT is no longer listed as an autism spec-
trum dis",h,5000
"sorder (ASD) in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM- V)
15. 
However, RTT patients who show autistic- like features 
may be described as having ASD associated with RTT.
Neural phenotypes of RTT
The gross observation of reduced brain volume in indi-
viduals with RTT is associated with abnormally small 
and densely packed neurons that are reduced in den-
dritic complexity and spine density16. The dendrites of 
pyramidal neurons in the motor and frontal cortices are 
considerably shorter than in non- RTT brains16. MRI 
data demonstrate selective reductions in the volume of 
the parietal and temporal lobes in female RTT patients, with preservation of the occipital cortex
17.
Following the identification of MECP2 as the prin-
cipal genetic factor underlying RTT18, enormous effort 
has been focused on modelling the disease using mouse 
and other animal models (BoX 1) and human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models (BoX 2).
MeCP2",h,6000
"P2 loss affects different cell types in multiple 
brain regions. MeCP2 is ubiquitously expressed but is enriched in the brain. Brain- specific deletion of Mecp2   
(Nestin–Mecp2
−/y) in mice captures key phenotypes, 
including reduced movement, abnormal gait, hindlimb 
clasping, respiratory abnormalities and early lethality, that 
present in Mecp2 -null mice19,20. This finding highlights a 
crucial role for the specificity of MeCP2 in the brain.
Region- specific knockout in the brain further reveals 
diverse roles of MeCP2 across various brain regions. For example, deletion of Mecp2 in the brainstem and spinal cord leads to abnormal heart rate and breathing patterns 
and early lethality
21,22; removal from dopaminergic and 
noradrenergic neurons induces motor incoordina-tion
23; and removal from serotonergic neurons increases 
aggression23. Evidently, the region- specific loss of Mecp2  
induces a subset of RTT phenotypes that correspond to the function of the targeted region. Furtherm",h,7000
"hermore, the loss 
of MeCP2 in all inhibitory neurons (in Viaat –Mecp2
−/y 
mice) strikingly reproduces severe forms of RTT phe-
notypes, highlighting the important contribution of 
inhibitory neurons and E/I balance to MeCP2-mediated functions in the brain
24. Deletion of Mecp2 from astro -
cytes in mice has relatively minor phenotypic conse-
quences, but restoration of MeCP2 in astrocytes in an 
otherwise MeCP2-deficient nervous system results in marked amelioration of phenotypes
25. Transplantation 
of wild- type microglia to a mouse model of RTT was 
reported to reverse symptoms26; however, multiple 
attempts to reproduce this finding were not successful27, pointing to the complexity of non- neuronal, potentially 
secondary, effects of MeCP2. Microglia have been sug-gested to contribute to RTT pathogenesis by excessively eliminating presynaptic inputs in fully symptomatic Mecp2-null mice. However, microglial- specific deletion 
(in Cx3cr1
CreER–Mecp2−/y mice) has minimal effects on",h,8000
"fects on 
microglial phagocytosis and synaptic loss, suggesting 
involvement of other cell types in this effect28.
Loss of MeCP2 affects multiple developmental stages. 
Consistent with studies of post- mortem RTT brains, sev-
eral early studies of mouse models suggested RTT to be a disorder of delayed neuronal maturation and synapse 
formation. These mouse models revealed reductions in 
neuronal soma size, dendritic arborization, spine density and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) immunore-activity as well as abnormal spine morphology
29–31. Such 
findings led to the belief that MeCP2 is predominantly 
involved in the maturation of neuronal function, through 
processes including synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and establishment of functional circuits. In line with the structural defects, alterations in synaptic transmission 
are observed at the circuit level in Mecp2-mutant mice. 
Loss of MeCP2 leads to changes in neuronal excitability 
and deficits in experience- dependent p",h,9000
" plasticity processes, 
such as homeostatic synaptic scaling, resulting in altered 
neuronal connectivity and shifts in E/I balance at the circuit level (see details below). These functional defi-
cits result from a failure of activity- dependent feedback 
mechanisms that require MeCP2 to establish and main-
tain functional brain circuits during neuronal maturation 
and throughout life
32,33. However, increasing evidence 
also suggests that MeCP2 has diverse and distinct roles in all stages of brain development, including the earliest 
stages of neurogenesis and neuronal migration 
(Fig.  1).
Initial reports in mouse models reported low MeCP2 
expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) — with little effect of MeCP2 deficiency in cultured neurospheres — and a progressive increase during embryonic and postna-tal development
34,35. More recent evidence now indicates 
that loss of MeCP2 affects early developmental stages con-
siderably. Clinical studies report subtle symptoms before

" 
6 months of age10,36–38 and early developmental delays 
before the full manifestation of RTT36,39,40. Male babies 
born with a mutant MECP2 allele, although very rare 
owing to the predominantly paternal origin of MECP2  
mutations, display severe neurological deficits from birth, 
including disproportionately small frontal and temporal 
lobes characteristic of a prenatal pathogenesis6.
Diverse phenotypes of RTT are present during 
neurogenesis and neuronal migration, and during the 
later stages of synaptic and circuit development and plasticity
41,42. Immunohistochemistry studies comparing 
wild- type cells with MeCP2-deficient cells suggest that 
MeCP2 is expressed in the prenatal cortex in mouse42 and 
in human iPSC- derived NPCs43. The neurogenic func-
tion of MeCP2 has been demonstrated in mouse NPC 
cultures: overexpression of MeCP2 in these cultures

as early as 3 days in vitro42. In Xenopus laevis , MeCP2 
regulates the transcriptional expression of the neuronal 
repressor gene XHairy2a (also known as hes4); depletion 
of MeCP2 protein and expression of a truncated form of 
MeCP2 (R168X) result in a decrease and an increase in 
the number of NPCs, respectively45. In zebrafish, genetic 
deletion of mecp2  inhibits neuronal differentiation, 
whereas Mecp2 overexpression promotes differentia -
tion46. Similarly, measurement of the expression of NPC 
markers and early neuronal markers in the Mecp2-null mouse brain shows an increase in NPC markers and a

decrease in neuronal markers, suggesting a possible imbalance in prenatal brain development
42. Moreover, 
alterations in human neurogenesis and neuronal differ -
entiation are observed in patient- derived iPSC cultures 
and cerebral organoids41. Even small deflections in the 
developmental programme may predispose the embryo 
to complex phenotypes later on. Such reports of an early 
developmental role for MeCP2 are particularly important when we consider treatment time points for RTT patients. Although postnatal re- expression of MeCP2 at later stages in Mecp2-mutant mice partially rescues several RTT phe-
notypes, including lifespan
47,48, the above findings suggest 
that earlier treatment would increase its effectiveness.
Earlier and more recent evidence suggests that MeCP2 
is required for the maintenance of mature neural net -
works49. Removing MeCP2 during postnatal development 
or in adulthood leads to rapid progression of RTT- like 
symptoms, including lethality50,51. Several ",h,13000
"synaptic pro-
teins, including NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunits and 
presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), 
are reduced upon postnatal removal of MeCP2 (ReF.50). 
Intriguingly, the levels of mRNA encoding these proteins 
remain unchanged, suggesting that MeCP2 probably reg-
ulates the levels of these proteins post- transcriptionally50.

adult brain, in vivo genome editing by injection of adeno-  
associated viral vector (AAV)–Streptococcus pyogenes

mary visual cortex (V1) depleted MeCP2 in 70% of the infected cells and led to altered visual responses, including  
reduced orientation selectivity and peak response
52.Box 1 | Translational insights from mice
Research into Rett syndrome (RTT) received a major impetus through the generation and wide availability of methyl-  
CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2)-mutant mice19,20. Mecp2-null (Mecp2−/y) male mice are used more",h,14000
" more often than female 
heterozygous (Mecp2+/−) mice, as the former display early- onset, severe symptoms similar to those in patients with RTT; 
namely, breathing irregularities and motor abnormalities, along with early lethality19,20. Female Mecp2+/− mice, which 
provide a more accurate genetic representation of the disorder, should be used as well as Mecp2−/y mice for preclinical 
studies for potential therapeutics112, even though their neurological symptoms develop later and they show higher 
phenotypic variability (owing to X chromosome inactivation)156.
mouse models for common missense mutations (including those encoding T158A, T158m and R306C substitutions) 
recapitulate RTT- like phenotypes68,157, 158. T158A and T158m affect the methyl- CpG-binding domain (mBD), reduce meCP2 
protein stability and cause reductions in the amplitude of event response potentials in the auditory cortex at the circuit 
level157, 158. R306C is a mutation that affects the nuclear receptor co- repress",h,15000
"epressor (NCoR)–silencing mediator for retinoic acid 
and thyroid hormone receptor (SmRT) interaction domain (NID) and abolishes the interaction of meCP2 with the NCoR–
SmRT complex68,69. As common missense mutations are highly relevant to RTT pathology, these models are valuable tools 
for preclinical studies.
one limitation of transgenic mouse models is that the onset of neurological symptoms occurs much later in 
development than in humans. moreover, RTT- related phenotypes may be less severe in rodents. other factors, including 
genetic background and rearing conditions, should be considered when analysing expressed phenotypes. Furthermore, RTT models in other species, including rats and non- human primates, have been developed. These recapitulate key 
features of RTT and offer unique behavioural features, including regression of a learned psychomotor skill in rats
159 and 
unique eye- tracking measures in primates160. Such models could enable cross- species validation in developin",h,16000
"oping preclinical 
outcome measures in the future159.
RTT animal models have helped to establish biomarkers to track disease progression and amelioration. Several 
behavioural assessments have been established to track the onset and severity of RTT in mouse models156. Unbiased, 
quantitative biomarkers of brain function and disease progression are needed. A recent study used frontal alpha- band 
electroencephalogram asymmetry, an index of anxiety and depression, in humans to evaluate the effects of insulin- like 
growth factor 1 (IGF1) treatment161. other measurable phenotypes have been suggested: Mecp2−/y mice exhibit 
regression of visual acuity in adulthood (as opposed to progressive increase of acuity during normal development)109, and 
Mecp2+/− mice and individuals with RTT exhibit decreases in the amplitude of cortical visually evoked potentials (vEPs)13. 
Therefore, a standardized vEP analysis might be useful in assessing preclinical and clinical therapeutic outcomes. The 
ideal",h,17000
"deal biomarker may combine behavioural and electrophysiological assessments.
mouse models have provided the basis for preclinical studies and therapeutic strategies for RTT (BoX 3). For example, 
several signalling pathways, including the brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)162 and IGF1 (ReF.29) pathways, are 
altered in RTT mouse models and are currently being targeted for potential therapeutics163. BDNF has important roles in 
synaptic maturation and plasticity. BDNF levels are reduced in Mecp2-mutant mice164, and candidate agents that increase 
BDNF levels (namely, glatiramer acetate and fingolimod) are in clinical trials165, 166 in RTT163. IGF1 regulates the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT–postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) pathway, a major pathway of excitatory synaptic maturation that is deficient in RTT model mice
29,84 and in individuals with RTT161. PSD95 is a highly abundant 
synaptic protein crucial for synaptic maturation and plasticity167, 168 and is upregu",h,18000
"pregulated by BDNF169 and IGF1 (ReFS29,170). 
PSD95 is deficient in Mecp2-null mice171 and is restored following systemic treatment with IGF1 (ReFS29,134). Indeed, IGF1 
treatment has shown efficacy in a phase I/IIa trial161. NNZ-2566, a synthetic analogue of IGF1, has been claimed to 
improve breathing and motor behaviour in patients with RTT; NNZ-2566 will soon advance to phase III trials.

Molecular effects
Since the discovery in 1999 that mutations in the MECP2  
gene were the underlying cause of RTT18, tremendous 
progress has been made in understanding the molec-
ular functions of MeCP2. Interacting with DNA is an 
essential part of MeCP2 function, as MeCP2 is pri-mar",h,19000
"marily a chromatin-  bound nuclear protein that acts as 
an 
epigenetic reader . On the basis of functional studies, 
MeCP2 has been proposed to regulate gene transcription, 
chromatin compaction and miRNA processing53. This 
section discusses the molecular effects of MeCP2 and how its loss contributes to neurological deficits in RTT.
Epigenetics of MeCP2–DNA interactions. MeCP2 was 
originally found to bind specifically to DNA that con-
tains methylated cytosines in CpG dinucleotides (mCG), 
via its methyl- CpG-binding domain (MBD), thus help-
ing to repress gene expression
7,54,55. However, it was 
recently reported that MeCP2 also interacts with methyl-
ated CA (mCA) sites56, and another report further speci-
fied the binding of MeCP2 to methylated CAC (mCAC) trinucleotides
57. Intriguingly, mCA is more abundant 
in postmitotic neurons, accumulates throughout devel-opment and seems to promote transcriptional repres-
sion
58,59. The sites that harbour mCA modifications are frequently",h,20000
"ly found in long genes  that have been shown 
to be preferentially expressed in RTT59. mCA sites are 
concentrated within gene bodies , which further suggests 
that MeCP2 obstructs transcription within transcribed 
regions60. A recent study suggested that mCA sites are 
methylated during early postnatal life by DNA (cyto-sine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A)
61 and that 
activity- induced sites are less DNMT3A- bound and are 
thus less methylated. This mCA- mediated repressive 
effect of MeCP2 is believed to mediate cell- type-specific 
transcriptional fine- tuning61.
The ability of MeCP2 to interact with DNA bearing 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was previously con-
troversial. Several independent studies now show that MeCP2 can bind to hydroxymethylated CA (hmCA) sites, but with a much lower affinity than to hydroxym-
ethylated CG (hmCG) sites (see 
ReF.56 for a more detailed 
discussion). 5hmC is frequently associated with gene activation (possibly owing to its low binding affinity",h,21000
" 
to MeCP2), whereas the binding of MeCP2 to mCG and mCA is associated with repression
62; specifically, 
5hmC is enriched in genes that are actively expressed 
in neurons62. It is possible that the hmCG modification 
may result in ‘functional demethylation’ of mCG sites, as it may promote the detachment of MeCP2 and thus Epigenetic reader

Intact human brains cannot be subjected to irreversible genetic manipulations or high- throughput drug screening, and 
human brain samples can be obtained only post- mortem and represent only the end point of the disorder. Hence, induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell culture models of human brain development have been important for 
elucidating specific cellular aspects of disease pathology. Genome editing u",h,22000
"ng using transcription activator- like effector 
nuclease (TAlEN) and CRISPR technologies, together with human neuronal cultures derived from people with Rett 
syndrome (RTT), has revealed structural, molecular and physiological RTT- related phenotypes during early developmental 
stages41,43,74,172– 175.
Isogenic controls are crucial for iPSC analyses. In RTT, neurons expressing only the non- mutated methyl- CpG-binding 
protein 2 (MECP2) allele can be generated from patients’ cells using random X chromosome inactivation, such that 
controls share the same genetic background as the patients41,43. Similar to RTT mouse models and post- mortem human 
patient samples, RTT iPSC- derived neurons demonstrate reductions in soma size, spine density, neuronal firing and 
activity- dependent signalling173. In addition, these cells show various signs of impaired neuronal maturation, including 
reduced expression of the neuronal marker TUJ1 (neuron- specific class III β- tubulin) and excitatory and",h,23000
"y and inhibitory 
neuronal markers, aberrant electrophysiological properties and deficits in activity- dependent transcription43,74,172, 175. 
moreover, RTT iPSC- derived cell cultures show impaired neuronal differentiation and migration41, and differentiated 
astrocytes derived from RTT patients have adverse effects on the morphology and function of wild- type neurons174.
Cerebral organoids are stem- cell-derived in vitro 3D structures, with a certain self- organizing capacity, that mimic, at 
least in part, in vivo brains. Although cerebral organoids currently can be used only to model early development of the human brain, several key features of in vivo brain organogenesis are recapitulated by in vitro organoids, which thus 
provide robust models for studying neurological disorders
176. RTT patient- derived cerebral organoids have recently been 
generated and exhibit abnormalities in neuronal proliferation and differentiation as well as reduced maturity — phenotypes also observed in",h,24000
"ved in human meCP2-deficient monolayer cultures
41. However, to avoid the variability driven by 
random X chromosome inactivation, cerebral organoids are generated primarily from cells that express only the mutant copy of MECP2; thus, the effect more closely mimics human male mutations, which are more severe. Therefore, it will be 
of great interest to generate cerebral organoids that more closely mimic female RTT brains, with heterozygous expression and random X inactivation.
one intriguing difference between mouse models and human RTT is their disease severity. The effects of meCP2 
deficiency are milder in rodents than in humans: Mecp2
−/y mice survive for several weeks postnatally, and Mecp2+/− mice 
show late symptom onset. This difference puts human iPSC- derived models in a unique position for studying RTT 
pathophysiology. With rapid advances in organoid- culturing strategies, cerebral organoids can develop over an 
extended period (more than 9 months), establishing late- devel",h,25000
"evelopmental and even mature features, including dendritic 
spine formation and active neuronal networks177. If or when cell- type-specific differentiation becomes a routine feature 
of these models, they and human- derived 2D cultures will be very useful for studying the interaction between excitatory 
and inhibitory neurons in the context of RTT178. In the meantime, cerebral organoids are suitable models to investigate 
early- developmental events, including neurogenesis and migration. As a future direction for precision medicine, drugs 
could potentially be tested on neuronal cultures derived from an individual with RTT before deciding whether they can 
be administered to the patient179.

MeCP2 as a transcriptional regulator . A large body of 
data on the role of MeCP2 indicates that it is primarily a transcriptional repressor
53, although MeCP2 has also 
been suggested to act as a transcriptional activator8.
A role for MeCP2 in transcriptional repression was 
supported by the negative correlation between mCA levels and transcription of long genes
59. Moreover, two 
separate studies emphasized the proportional relationship 
between DNA methylation levels, MeCP2 binding on 
the genome and transcriptional repression57,60. MeCP2 is 
highly abundant (there are an estimated 16 million mole-
cules of MeCP2 per neuronal nucleus, compared with an 
estimated 32 million nucleosomes per nucleus), suggest-ing that it binds genome wide
64. Thus, converging lines of evidence suggest that the repressive effects of MeCP2 are genome wide and p",h,27000
"positively correlated with the density of methylation of CG and CA sites in gene bodies
65.
Furthermore, microarray profiling and whole- cell 
RNA sequencing indicate that the repressive effect of MeCP2 is biased towards long genes larger than 100 kb, 
and expression of mutant MeCP2 leads to upregula-tion of the expression of long genes
59,66. More specifi-
cally, highly methylated long genes — and not lowly 
methylated long genes — are upregulated in MECP2  
mutants59,60. A recent study analysing mice carrying 
specific RTT- associated Mecp2 mutations (namely, those 
encoding the T158M and R106W substitutions) showed 
that gene expression changes are largely mutation-  
specific and cell- type-specific67. Nuclear transcriptomes 
from forebrain neurons of these mutant mice reveal 
reductions in the nascent transcription of long genes 
and suggest a functional compensation for the reduc -
tions in long gene expression at the whole- cell level via 
post- transcriptional mechanisms67. How",h,28000

long genes affected by MeCP2 loss, which is particu-
larly important because other studies found that only 
highly methylated long genes are upregulated in Mecp2-
knockout mice59,60. Future studies will be required to fur -
ther delineate the effects of var",h,30000
"rious MECP2  mutations on 
the transcriptional regulation of long genes in different 
neuronal cell types and to correlate these effects with the methylation status of long genes.
Considerable progress has recently been made in 
resolving the molecular mechanisms underlying the repressor role of MeCP2. MeCP2 has been reported to interact with the histone deacetylase (HDAC)–SIN3A co-  
repressor complex as well as with the HDAC3-containing 
nuclear receptor co- repressor (NCoR)–silencing mediator 
for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) 
complex
55,68. The recruitment of the NCoR–SMRT com-
plex has been particularly implicated in mediating the 
repressive effects of MeCP2 (ReF.68). The NCoR–SMRT complex contains multiple subunits, including NCoR, 
SMRT, HDAC3, G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) and transducin β- like protein 1 (TBL1) or its paralogue 
TBL1-related protein 1 (TBLR1)
69. MeCP2 recruits the 
NCoR–SMRT complex by directly interacting with TBL1 
and TBLR1 th",h,31000
"nd TBLR1 through its NCoR–SMRT interaction domain 
(NID) within its transcriptional repression domain (TRD)
69. In this model, the HDAC3-containing NCoR–
SMRT complex is recruited by MeCP2 when MeCP2 is 
bound to DNA, and modulates chromatin structure by 
removing acetyl groups from histone lysine residues55,68 
(Fig.  3). Notably, RTT-  associated Mecp2  mutations (such 
as R306C) that affect the NID of MeCP2 result in severe 
RTT phenotypes68, and a recent study demonstrated that 
the MBD and NID of MeCP2 may be most phenotypi-cally relevant for RTT
70. Thus, the primary function of 
MeCP2 is probably to connect methylated DNA with the NCoR–SMRT co- repressor complex. The binding of  Box 3 | Therapeutic strategies for RTT
There currently exist two major objectives in the development of therapeutic strategies: therapeutic targets downstream 
of methyl- CpG-binding protein 2 (meCP2) and gene therapy. Postnatal restoration of meCP2 in Mecp2-mutant mice 
rescues several Rett syndrome (RT",h,32000
"ome (RTT) phenotypes, emphasizing the reversibility of this devastating disorder47,48,180. Several 
treatment strategies that are based on targeting signalling downstream of meCP2, such as increasing brain- derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF1), have improved certain RTT features in preclinical tests 
and are in clinical trials161, 163 (BoX 1). Given the diverse functional targets of meCP2, it is likely that no single signalling 
pathway can explain disruptions resulting from meCP2 dysfunction or loss. Rather, the development of novel treatment 
strategies must take into account not only the validity and specificity of the therapeutic target (that is, the mechanism of 
drug action and its relevance to meCP2 mechanisms) but also the diversity of the effects of meCP2 dysfunction or loss on 
different brain regions and cell types and during different developmental phases as well as on the time course of disease 
progression. Furthermore, therapeutic e",h,33000
"effectiveness is influenced by various factors, including the stratification and validity of patient populations and their match to preclinical drug validation models, drug dosage, trial onset and 
duration, effectiveness of biomarkers and choice of end points. Considering the temporal and regional features of RTT 
discussed in the main text, and the issues mentioned above, the most effective therapeutics will probably target mechanisms as directly, and as early, as possible. Current therapeutic strategies for RTT, including those in clinical trials, have been reviewed recently
163.
As inhibitory dysfunction is a major feature of RTT, its modulation is a feasible approach to a functional treatment for 
RTT. As excitation is also reduced in forebrain areas in Mecp2-mutant mice, enhancing excitation should also be 
considered for treatment strategies. Strikingly, deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the hippocampus rescues memory deficits in Mecp2-mutant mice
181, 182, presumably by mo",h,34000
"dulating the excitation and inhibition of local circuits183. This 
finding opens a potential new avenue for RTT therapy. mechanism- based approaches, such as IGF1 treatment (BoX 1), 
restore inhibition and excitation in Mecp2-mutant mice101. Ketamine, an NmDA receptor antagonist, improves specific 
functions, including forebrain activity (as indicated by FoS expression) and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle in Mecp2
−/y and Mecp2+/− mice, respectively106. meCP2-deficient mice and neurons derived from individuals with RTT show a 
lower K+/Cl− exporter 2 (KCC2):Na+/K+/Cl− symporter (NKCC1) ratio, leading to abnormal GABA- induced changes in 
membrane response and thus reduced inhibition. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide could thus be a potential candidate
101, 130, although the development of molecules that enhance 
KCC2 function would be an important advance.
owing to the complexity of meCP2 dysfunction in RTT, gene therapy is poss",h,35000
"y is possibly the most direct approach for treating 
the disorder. In principle, gene therapy would need to be attempted as early as possible, but the level of meCP2 would 
have to be accurately titrated, as overdosage of meCP2 or duplication of MECP2 would lead to severe neurological 
consequences153– 155. Current evidence supports four potential gene therapy strategies11,163. First, delivery of Mecp2 gene 
using an adeno- associated virus serotype 9 (AA v9) vector through intravenous injection partially rescues RTT- like 
features in Mecp2-mutant mice184. Second, molecules such as aminoglycoside antibiotics (for example, gentamyicin) can 
enable ribosomes to read across meCP2-encoding RNA despite nonsense mutations185, 186 and could therefore potentially 
be used to target nonsense mutations that generate truncated meCP2. Third, small molecules can activate normal MECP2  
alleles on the inactive X chromosome (Xi)187. A recent study used a mixed- modality approach, combining brain- sp",h,36000
"specific 
deletion of X- inactivation master regulator Xist and a small- molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation, to selectively 
reactivate Xi in mice in vivo188. Fourth, gene editing using CRISPR–Cas9 techniques may be used to correct point 
mutations. As a complementary proof of principle, the CRISPR–Cas9 technique has been shown to be able to remove 70% of meCP2 protein in the mouse hippocampus
52. Site- directed RNA editing mediated by double- stranded RNA- specific 
editase 1 (ADAR2; also known as ADARB1) can correct disease- causing mutations affecting the mouse meCP2 DNA-  
binding domain in vitro, repairing 72% of Mecp2 mRNA189. Although many technical barriers remain, the potential for 
gene therapy for RTT warrants further exploration.

the NCoR–SMRT complex to MeCP2 is also regulated in  
an activity- dependent manner (see below) ",h,37000
"e below) and is required 
for MeCP2-mediated gene repression68,71. Although the 
relationship between methylation density and MeCP2 
occupancy across the genome is well established, whether 
the MeCP2–NCoR–SMRT–HDAC3 complex is recruited in a density- dependent way, and is concentrated in the 
gene bodies of long genes, remains to be determined.
Notably, transcriptome analyses have revealed 
upregulation and downregulation of different genes in MeCP2-deficient mouse brains
8,72,73. As such, MeCP2 
has been suggested to also act as a transcriptional acti-
vator and is thought to do so via its interaction with 
cAMP-  responsive element-  binding protein 1 (CREB1)8. 
However, no RTT mutation has yet been reported to 
interrupt MeCP2–CREB1 interaction. One possible 
explanation for the downregulation of a large numbers of genes in MeCP2-deficient neurons is that the tran -
scriptional machinery does not function optimally, as 
reflected by the reduction of soma size and total RNA 
in RTT ",h,38000
"
in RTT mouse models and in iPSC- derived neurons 
from individuals with RTT
57,74. This suggestion is 
consistent with the proposed function of MeCP2 as a 
multifunctional hub of cellular metabolism74.
A recent study suggested that MeCP2 might act as 
a positive regulator for a subset of neuronal genes via 
its NID75. At certain gene promoters, MeCP2 recruits 
HDAC3 to deacetylate the transcription factor fork-
head box protein O3 (FOXO3) to positively regulate 
transcription (Fig.  3). In support of this mechanism, 
Hdac3 -mutant mice (which show RTT- like pheno-
types) and human iPSC- derived NPCs harbouring 
MECP2R306C show mislocalization of FOXO3 (outside of 
gene promoters) and downregulation of target genes75. Nevertheless, this mechanism is surprising, as methyl-ation density and MeCP2 occupancy are known to be low in 
transcription start sites , and MeCP2 generally binds 
within gene bodies57,76. To reconcile these observations, 
one possibility is that the binding of MeCP2 t",h,39000
"to the gene 
body represses transcription, whereas its recruitment of 
HDAC3 to certain gene promoters positively regulates transcription through FOXO3 deacetylation
75.
An additional model proposes that MeCP2 directly 
interacts with DNA and thus modifies chromatin archi-tecture globally
64,77 (Fig.  3). Mecp 2-null brains show global 
alterations in neuronal chromatin architecture, including 
increases in histone acetylation and elevated levels of linker 
histone H1 (ReF.64). As the NID contains a cluster of basic 
amino acids, it may act as a DNA- binding domain78. In 
addition, MeCP2 has three AT hooks  that could bend DNA 
and assist chromatin- structure remodelling77.
Also relevant to a role for MeCP2 in maintaining chro-
matin structure is the interaction between MeCP2 and  
the transcription regulating helicase ATRX. MeCP2  
and ATRX colocalize on pericentric heterochromatin, and  
ATRX is mislocalized in MeCP2-deficient neurons77,79. 
The MeCP2–ATRX interaction may be importan",h,40000
"tant 
for the formation of higher- order chromatin loops77. 
However, more direct evidence is required to demon-strate how MeCP2 may regulate chromatin structure, as 
well as the role of a loss of MeCP2–ATRX interactions in RTT pathology.

through oxidation of mCG to hydroxymethylated CG (hmCG) by the ten- eleven translocation (TET) enzyme. As MeCP2 has 
a low affinity for hmCG, this modification results in the detachment of MeCP2, leading to derepression of transcription63.

". MeCP2 interacts directly with transducin β- like 
protein 1 (TBL1) in the NCoR–SMRT complex via its NCoR–SMRT interaction domain (NID)69. This function is abolished 
in NID variants of MeCP2, such as R306C MeCP2. MeCP2 has also been suggested to compact chromatin structure

MeCP2 binds to the microprocessor complex protein DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8) and inhibits ribonuclease 3 (DROSHA) from binding; thus, MeCP2 may inhibit the processing of pri- miR-134

Mecp2-null mice9,82–85; in mouse MeCP2-deficient neu-
ronal cultures86–89; and in iPSC- derived neuronal cultures 
and cerebral organoids generated from individuals with 
RTT41. The importance of miRNA–MeCP2 interactions 
in understanding RTT is being determined by studies of how MeCP2 loss alters miRNA expression
9,41,86–89 and the 
different MeCP2 domains (discussed above) and RTT-  
associated MECP2 mutations that could be implicated 
in miRNA alterations9,41.
MeCP2 represses the transcription of primary miR",h,45000
"rimary miRNAs  
(pri- miRNAs), including miR-137, miR-15a, miR-184 
and miR-7b, by binding to mCG sites in the gene pro -
moter regions86–89. MeCP2 deficiency results in increased 
pri- miRNA transcription, which leads to increased 
mature miRNA levels. Therefore, RTT- associated muta-
tions in the genetic sequence encoding the MeCP2 MBD 
and TRD or NID are expected to result in increases in such MeCP2-regulated intergenic miRNAs. Furthermore, 
MeCP2 can directly inhibit miRNA expression by block -
ing pri- miRNA processing. MeCP2 may do this by bind-
ing to the microprocessor protein DiGeorge syndrome 
critical region 8 (DGCR8) via the carboxy- terminal 
domain
9 and thus hindering the interaction of DGCR8 
with the other main component of the microprocessor 
complex, ribonuclease 3 (DROSHA) (Fig.  3). This mode of 
action has been shown to lead to increased pri- miR-134 
processing and mature miR-134 expression in the hip-
pocampus of adult Mecp2 -mutant mice9. In individuals 
with R",h,46000
"h RTT who carry MECP2 C- terminal mutations or 
truncations, the binding between MeCP2 and DGCR8 is expected to be abolished, leaving DROSHA free to bind and activate pri-  miR-134 processing 
(Fig.  3). Intriguingly, 
MeCP2 loss- mediated increases in miR-137, miR-15a, 
miR-7b and miR-134 each lead to impaired dendritic maturation
87,89,90, a major feature of RTT.
Another set of miRNAs are indirectly regulated by 
MeCP2. miR-199 is robustly upregulated in iPSC- derived 
neuronal cultures from individuals with RTT who carry a missense mutation encoding a R106W substitution in the MBD of MeCP2, or a frameshift mutation that results in 
a truncated transcript (V247X), and in MeCP2-deficient 
mouse neurons
41. Bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) 
activates SMAD signalling, which in turn promotes the 
processing of pri- miRNAs, and BMP4 is upregulated 
in certain MeCP2-mutant models91,92. Therefore, the 
upregulation of mature miR-199 observed in the RTT cultures probably results from elevat",h,47000
"ted BMP4–SMAD 
signalling 
(Fig.  3). The upregulation of miR-199 inhib-
its extracellular- signal-regulated kinase signalling and 
disrupts early neuronal development and differentia-tion
41. Similarly, MeCP2 deficiency results in increased 
let-7f miRNA expression in the postnatal mouse brain, 
through reductions in the BDNF- regulated repressor of 
let-7 miRNA biogenesis, protein lin-28 homologue A  
(LIN28A)93,94. In turn, this increase in let-7f inhibits the 
expression of insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in the 
postnatal mouse brain84. Treatment with the β2-adrenergic  
receptor agonist clenbuterol restores the affected mole-cular pathway and ameliorates diverse symptoms of 
Mecp2
−/y mice and Mecp2+/− mice84. Taken together, these 
findings suggest that RTT- relevant mutations70 could 
alter diverse miRNA pathways downstream of MeCP2 and result in disturbances in brain development and maturation.
Last, miRNAs may regulate MeCP2 expression. For 
example, miR-483-5p regulates",h,48000
"egulates MeCP2 isoforms through 
a human- specific target site in the 3´-untranslated region 
of MECP2 in developing neurons
95. In addition, miR-
200a and miR-302c inhibit MeCP2 expression in human embryonic stem cells
96, and miR-130a regulates neurite 
and synaptic maturation in the developing cortex through its inhibitory effect on MeCP2 expression
97. Intriguingly, 
some miRNAs, such as miR-132 and miR-7b, act in a feedback loop as both targets and regulators of MeCP2 
expression to fine- tune MeCP2 levels in the postnatal 
brain
85,89,98.
MeCP2 binds broadly across the genome; therefore, 
it will remain a challenge to deduce the primary actions of MeCP2 from RNA analyses. Thus, future studies focusing on MeCP2 binding sites (such as methylated DNA) and relating these to miRNA expression will pro-
vide crucial information for further analyses of MeCP2 
function and about the roles of miRNAs in RTT.
Excitatory and inhibitory circuits
Neurological symptoms in individuals with RTT an",h,49000
"nd in Mecp2-mutant mice result from neural circuit altera-
tions brought on by the loss of MeCP2. In Mecp2-mutant mice, E/I balance in circuits and brain regions is com-plexly altered; the maintenance of this balance is crucial for nearly every aspect of normal brain function.
Neuronal circuit deficits with MeCP2 loss are region-  
specific. Somatosensory cortex neurons in brain slices 
and cultured neurons from Mecp2
−/y mice exhibit smaller 
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), 
with no changes in miniature inhibitory postsynap-
tic currents (mIPSCs), resulting in an overall reduced excitation
29,99,100. In vivo whole- cell recordings of vis-
ually evoked responses in V1 pyramidal neurons reveal 
a combined reduction of excitatory and inhibitory con-
ductance in Mecp2−/y mice, with a net increase in the E/I 
ratio101. Similarly, there is a shift towards hyperexcita-
tion in the CA1 and CA3 region of the hippocampus 
in Mecp2−/y mice resulting from reduced mIPSCs102, 
",h,50000
"s102, 
and synaptic hyperexcitability is observed in brainstem areas, including the locus coeruleus
103, ventrolateral 
medulla104,105 and nucleus tractus solitarus106.
As a direct demonstration of the region- specific 
changes in activity in Mecp2−/y mice, expression of the 
immediate early gene Fos  is decreased in the forebrain 
and increased in the hindbrain106. Gene expression ana-
lyses of different neuronal cell types in Mecp2-knockout mouse brains showed variation in different sets of genes 
in these different cell populations
66. Clinically, selective 
volume reductions in the dorsal parietal and anterior 
frontal lobe regions in individuals with RTT also suggest 
that some brain regions are more affected than others17.
Overall, these studies highlight an intriguing 
region specificity of disruption to neural circuits that may explain the clinical features of RTT. For exam-ple, reduced excitation and connectivity in forebrain motor areas probably contributes to motor dysfunc -",h,51000

region probably leads to abnormalities in breathing pat-
terns21. Similarly, hyperexcitability in the hippocampus  
probably contributes to the limbic seizures observed in  
Mecp2-mutant mice and people with RTT107.
Although the mechanisms underlying this region spec-
ificity remain unclear, two non- mutually exclusive possi-
bilities can be extrapolated. First, MeCP2 may differentially affect different brain regions. Second, although MeCP2 may function similarly in different regions, some neurons 
or circuits may be more vulnerable to MeCP2 dysfunction 
than others, owing to their connectivity (see",h,52000
"e below).
MeCP2 loss affects excitatory and inhibitory neurons. 
Although the molecular effects of MeCP2 seem to be pri-
marily mediated by its MBD and NID (see previous sec-tion), the functional effects of MeCP2 are region- specific 
and cell- type-specific (for example, selective for exhibitory 
or inhibitory neuron subtypes). The functional effects of MeCP2 loss depend on the disruption of E/I imbalance within neuronal circuits
101, and neuronal circuits seem to 
be particularly sensitive to MeCP2 loss from inhibitory 
neurons24. We therefore suggest that the molecular effects 
of MeCP2 are not equal across functional cell classes and functional brain regions. Deletion of MeCP2 from func-
tional cell types can provide insights into the primacy of MeCP2 function in specific cell types. One study that used cell- type-specific biotin tagging of MeCP2 in wild-  type 
mice, Mecp2
T158M/y mice and Mecp2R106W/y mice to profile 
nuclear transcriptomes revealed distinct sets of differen-
tia",h,53000
"lly regulated genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons 
in the Mecp2 mutants67. This finding is consistent with 
the observation that the landscape of DNA methylation 
varies between excitatory and inhibitory neurons61,108. If 
the methylation landscape varies across cell types, MeCP2 may exert different molecular actions in different cell 
types, leading to cell- specific transcriptional alterations 
with MeCP2 mutations.
Several symptoms of whole- brain Mecp2 deletion, 
including ataxia, repetitive behaviours, deficits in motor coordination and obesity, are strikingly recapitulated in mice with Mecp2 deletion in inhibitory neurons (Viaat - 
Mecp2
−/y mice). In addition, the reductions in GABA 
synthesis and mIPSCs in Viaat - Mecp2−/y mice24 are also 
observed in whole- brain Mecp2 deletion101, 109. Mice 
lacking MeCP2 in forebrain excitatory neurons exhibit 
milder behavioural phenotypes, including tremor and 
anxiety- like behaviours, which are less evident in mice 
lacking MeCP2 ",h,54000
"CP2 in inhibitory neurons110,111. Furthermore, 
re- expression of MeCP2 in inhibitory neurons, but not 
in excitatory neurons, rescues motor coordination defi-cits in Mecp2-knockout mice
110,112. These studies indicate 
that primary deficits in excitatory signalling or inhibi-
tory signalling caused by cell- type-specific MeCP2 loss 
lead to distinct neurological phenotypes.
Inhibitory neurons and RTT . GABAergic inhibitory neu-
rons account for up to 20% of the total neurons in the 
brain113. In particular, subtypes of inhibitory neurons are 
known to have very different developmental programmes, 
circuit influences and effects on activity- dependent 
plasticity113,114. Among the interneuron populations are 
three major subclasses that directly influence pyramidal neurons: soma- targeting parvalbumin (PV)-expressing 
neurons, dendrite-  targeting somatostatin (SOM)-
expressing neurons and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide 
(VIP)-expressing neurons113,115,116. SOM+ neurons inte -
grate",h,55000
" large numbers of inputs117 and seem to be crucial 
for feedback or top- down modulation118. VIP+ neurons 
are a subset of the serotonin receptor (5-HT3A)-expressing 
subclass of inhibitory neurons and receive top- down 
inputs; they disinhibit pyramidal neurons by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons
113,119. PV+ neurons form intricate 
nests of synaptic contacts on the soma of target pyramidal 
neurons, providing fast control over their excitability115. 
PV+ neurons, which mainly subserve feedforward inhibi-
tion and gain control120,121, have been suggested to be the 
major drivers of E/I balance in cortical circuits122.
Intriguingly, Mecp2 deletion from different GABAergic 
neuronal subtypes generates differential and non-  
overlapping symptoms and phenotypes; mice lacking 
MeCP2 in PV+ neurons show sensory, motor and memory 
deficits, whereas mice lacking MeCP2 in SOM+ neurons 
exhibit seizures and stereotypies123. These different effects 
of Mecp2 deletion in inhibitory neuron sub",h,56000
"types possibly 
reflect the different developmental and integrative circuit properties of these subtypes.
Anatomically, Mecp2
−/y mice, particularly juveniles, 
exhibit more PV+ puncta and increased PV+ neuron 
connections in the visual cortex compared with wild-  
type mice109,124. In addition, Mecp2−/y mice show alter -
ations in NMDAR subunit expression, with a greater 
NR2A:NR2B ratio in PV+ neurons, suggesting abnor -
mally accelerated NMDAR maturation125. Reducing 
NR2A expression in Mecp2−/y mice (achieved by cross-
ing heterozygous Mecp2+/− mice with NR2A- deficient 
males) reduces the PV+-cell hyperconnectivity and 
prevents the regression of visual acuity109,125. However, 
reductions in inhibition — including reduced PV+ neu-
ron responses — have consistently been reported in V1 of adult Mecp2
−/y mice, Viaat - Mecp2−/y mice (which lack 
MeCP2 from all GABAergic cells) and PV+ cell- specific

One proposed explanation to reconcile reports of 
hyperconnectivity of PV+ neurons with reduced func-
tional inhibition of pyramidal neurons in Mecp2-mutant 
mice is that the effectiveness of GABA as an inhibitory 
neurotransmitter may be altered in RTT mouse mod-els. Indeed, recent studies (see below) demonstrate that GABA is less hyperpolarizing in Mecp2-mutant 
mice
101 and in iPSC- derived neurons generated from 
RTT patients127. Thus, PV+ neuron hyperconnectivity 
may represent a homeostatic, compensatory response to the reduction in inhibition in cortical circuits 
(Fig.  4). 
Neurodevelopmental disorders are marked by germline or early genetic mutations and a cascade of changes 
that are superimposed on developmental programmes of growth and plasticity; altogether, these factors lead to altered ne",h,58000

and indirect effects are deeply intertwined in creating

KCC2:NKCC1 imbalance in RTT . The neuronal cation–
chloride co- transporters KCC2 (a K+/Cl− exporter) and 
NKCC1 (a Na+/K+/Cl− importer) set the transmem-
brane chloride gradient and determine the maturation 
of GABAergic inhibition128, 129. During typical brain 
development, GABAergic currents shift their polar -
ity from depolarization to hyperpolarization as the 
KCC2:NKCC1 ratio increases. GABA typically hyper -
polarizes (inhibits) mature neurons, as they have very low intracellular chloride",h,59000
"hloride levels, whereas GABA has less 
inhibitory, or even depolarizing (excitatory), effects on 
immature neurons, which show high intracellular chlo-ride concentrations
130. Increased intracellular chloride 
concentrations and KCC2–NKCC1 imbalance have been 
reported in animal models of fragile X syndrome  and in 
other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders131,132.
Recent evidence suggests that such alterations are 
also present in RTT. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from 
individuals with RTT have revealed that levels of KCC2 relative to NKCC1 are reduced
133. The expression of 
KCC2 in iPSC- derived neuronal cultures generated from 
individuals with RTT, and in V1 of Mecp2−/y mice, is also 
reduced, and this reduction causes the reversal potential  
of GABA to be less negative than in controls101, 127. 
Overexpression of KCC2 in iPSC- derived neurons gen-
erated from individuals with RTT rescues this functional deficit
127. IGF1 treatment, which partially rescues behav-
ioural a",h,60000
"al and synaptic deficits in mutant mouse models of 
RTT29,134, also increases the KCC2:NKCC1 ratio by pro-
moting KCC2 expression and restoring the inhibitory action of GABA
135. Thus, the circuit effects of MeCP2 
loss crucially include reduced inhibition owing to reduced KCC2 expression and a reduced KCC2:NKCC1 
ratio 
(Fig.  4).
Activity- dependent plasticity
Neuronal circuits are subject to experience- driven136,137 
or learning- driven138– 140 changes that cause neurons 
within a microcircuit or an ensemble to modify their 
functional connectivity and responses141. The devel -
opment of excitatory142 and inhibitory143 microcircuits 
and the maintenance of E/I balance122 require activity-  
dependent mechanisms, including Hebbian and homeo-static plasticity. Whereas the term Hebbian plasticity 
describes associative and input-  specific potentiation 
or depression of the strength of a synapse, homeo-static plasticity describes a negative feedback-  driven 
mechanism that maintains ",h,61000
"ns appropriate levels of over -
all activity and synaptic strength in neurons and cir -
cuits
144. Together, these mechanisms enable neuronal 
activity to induce pleotropic effects on gene expres-
sion to regulate synaptic molecule levels and function, 
and allow neuronal circuits to respond dynamically  
to experience.
Impaired homeostatic machinery resulting in 
altered experience- dependent refinement of circuits 
may be a core functional mechanism underlying autism and RTT
33,145,146. Recent evidence indicates that 
early- life experience or changes in activity, such as that 
induced by dark rearing, alter methylation, which influ-ences MeCP2 binding and hence gene expression
61. The 
reverse is also true: Mecp2 mutations result in changes in experience- dependent plasticity, including (but not 
limited to) homeostatic plasticity147– 149. For example, 
retinogeniculate synapses  in Mecp2-null mice show a 
lack of experience- dependent refinement, despite an

connectivity150. Mecp2-mutant mice also show substan-
tial impairments in experience- dependent plasticity in 
the visual cortex29,134. Closure of one eye during a criti-
cal period of development can cause ocular dominance 
plasticity, which leads to decreased and increased visual 
cortex responses to the deprived and non- deprived 
eye, respectively151. In Mecp2-mutant mice, the critical 
period during which ocular dominance plasticity can 
be induced is prolonged and extends into adulthood, 
mainly because adult mice still show a persistent home-ostatic upscaling of cortical responses to stimulation of the non-  deprived eye
134. Similarly, PV+ cell-  ",h,65000
" specific 
Mecp2−/y mice exhibit deprivation- induced plasticity 
in adulthood, accompanied by a reduction of inhibi-
tion101. This persistent experience- dependent plasticity 
is corrected by treatment with IGF1, which has cru -
cial roles in the maturation of PV+ circuits as well as 
GABAergic inhibition29,101. A critical level of inhibition 
is also required to initiate plasticity. PV+-cell- specific 
Mecp2−/y mice fail to show ocular dominance plasticity 
during the critical period, consistent with a reduc-tion of inhibition, and restoring inhibition through 
intracortical infusion of the GABA agonist diazepam restores plasticity
126.
The activity- induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 at 
the NID is important for activity- dependent plasticity. 
Neuronal activity induces phosphorylation of MeCP2 at several sites, including T308 
(ReF.71). Phosphorylation at 
T308 blocks the interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR–
SMRT complex, thus suppressing the ability of MeCP2 
to repress transcription",h,66000
"iption71. A human RTT- associated 
missense mutation in MECP2 , leading to a R306C substi -
tution, abolishes phosphorylation of MeCP2 at T308 and the interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR–SMRT com-plex
68,71. Importantly, both Mecp2R306C and Mecp2T308A 
knock- in mice show RTT- like behavioural phenotypes, 
although Mecp2R306C knock- in mice display a more severe 
phenotype68,71. A subset of activity- regulated genes that 
influence inhibitory neurons, including Npas4 and 
Bdnf , are downregulated in Mecp2T308A mice71, possibly 
providing a molecular mechanism for the alterations in inhibition in these animals. Thus, dysregulation of 
activity- dependent signalling that is normally mediated 
by the NID of MeCP2 likely contributes crucially to RTT pathophysiology.
Conclusions and perspectives
MeCP2 has spatiotemporally diverse effects depending on brain regions, phases of development and cell types. 
MeCP2 regulates multiple stages of brain development, 
including prenatal neurogenesis, p",h,67000
" postnatal development of synaptic connections and function, and experience- dependent refinement of neural circuits. Like many 
other brain disorders, RTT is associated with dysfunc-
tion reflective of functional failure at several levels, including the levels of gene regulation, molecular expres-sion, synaptic function and neuronal circuitry, and at 
various developmental stages.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the primary 
role of MeCP2 is transcriptional repression, with the 
MBD and NID of MeCP2 connecting methylated DNA 
with the NCoR–SMRT co- repressor complex. However, it remains unclear how certain missense mutations, such 
as that encoding the T158M substitution in the MBD, confer more severe clinical symptoms than do mutations 
affecting the NID (such as that encoding the R306C sub-
stitution)
152. Examining transcriptomes associated with 
different RTT mutations could provide critical insights 
into the differences in clinical severity.
At the molecular level, one majo",h,68000
"jor question is how 
MeCP2 loss produces the subtle yet widespread effects 
on neuron- enriched long genes, key activity- dependent 
signalling pathways and a large array of miRNAs. All of these effects may reflect the ability of MeCP2 to interact widely across the genome. To better under -
stand the functions of MeCP2, an important next step 
will be to evaluate, in detail, the molecular events that 
occur following MeCP2 binding to the gene bod-ies across the genome. Another feature of RTT to be resolved is a reduction in total RNA
57,74, which is poten-
tially due to suboptimal functioning of transcriptional 
machinery and which may explain the large number of 
downregulated genes in RTT.
The molecular mechanisms of MeCP2 loss manifest 
as dysfunction in brain circuits. The wiring and func-
tion of brain circuits depend on proper functioning of  
inhibitory and excitatory neurons and maintenance 
of E/I balance, all of which require MeCP2. A major functional contributor to RTT pheno",h,69000
"types is altera-
tion of inhibition, owing to altered gene expression in 
GABAergic neurons and a reduction in inhibitory drive onto pyramidal cells. Importantly, the NID mediates activity- dependent functions of MeCP2 and hence 
probably influences activity- dependent maturation of 
inhibitory neurons and the function of GABA receptors.
A key outstanding question is how a loss of the 
molecular functions of MeCP2 leads to the functional 
circuit deficits in RTT phenotypes. Are there cell-  
type-specific effects of the loss of the normal molecular 
mechanisms of MeCP2? In particular, it will be impor -
tant to establish the effects of mutations affecting the 
MBD or NID on PV
+ neurons and to investigate how 
these domains shape the properties of PV+ neurons and 
hence functional circuits. Experimentally, combining single- cell RNA sequencing and physiology offers an 
opportunity to dissect such alterations, thus bridg-
ing molecular dysregulation and circuit dysfunction following MeC",h,70000
"P2 loss.
The development of treatment strategies 
(BoX 3) must 
take into account the functional properties of MeCP2 dis-
cussed in this Review and consider the therapeutic tar -
get, brain region, cell type and time of application. More 
directly targeted therapeutics that are administered as early as possible are likely to be the most effective. Gene therapy 
is a potentially powerful approach 
(BoX 3), although, nota-
bly, the protein level of MeCP2 must be tightly titrated, as overdosage of MeCP2, similar to MECP2 duplication, 
would lead to severe neurological consequences
153– 155. 
A fuller understanding of RTT based on our increasing 
knowledge of the neurobiology and function of MeCP2, 
together with rapidly advancing genome- editing tools, 
could lead to an effective treatment for RTT.
